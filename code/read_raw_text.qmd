Here is the strategy:
  1.  **Split the data** into the major column blocks (e.g., Block 1: Recipient details; Block 2: Financial/Date details).
2.  **Determine fixed widths** for each block separately, assuming internal consistency.
3.  **Parse each block** into a temporary data frame.
4.  **Join the blocks** row-by-row (since they correspond to the same records).
5.  **Clean the result.**
